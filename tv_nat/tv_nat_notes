# using a linux machine with wifi and ethernet adapter to NAT network traffic between a wireless network and ethernet connected Smart TV (that does not have a wireless interface)

# enable ip_forwarding:
cp ./nat_sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/


# setup the ethernet interface in the appropriate ifcfg-* file:
# make sure the following line is present so all incoming traffic uses the wireless interface default route and not its own:
DEFROUTE=no


# add firewalld rules:
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat POSTROUTING 0 -o wlp2s0 -j MASQUERADE
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i wlp2s0 -o enp3s0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 1 -i enp3s0 -o wlp2s0 -j ACCEPT

# note the priority of 1 for the final rule, this allows a logging rule to be added before this to see what is happening to traffic coming in on the Ethernet interface as such:
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -j LOG
